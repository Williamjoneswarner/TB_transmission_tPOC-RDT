# TB_transmission_tPOC-RDT
A stochastic compartmental model simulating TB transmission and progression to evaluate a novel point-of-care rapid diagnostic (tPOC-RDT) with increased rural coverage. This model is under active development and aims to inform equitable diagnostic strategies in low-resource settings.
