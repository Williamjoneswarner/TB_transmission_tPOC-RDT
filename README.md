TB_transmission_tPOC-RDT

Overview

This repository hosts a stochastic, individual-based compartmental model of tuberculosis (TB) transmission and progression, developed to evaluate the potential impact of a novel point-of-care rapid diagnostic test (tPOC-RDT) with enhanced rural diagnostic coverage. The model simulates TB dynamics under two scenarios: (1) baseline conditions reflecting current diagnostic access and delays, and (2) implementation of the tPOC-RDT.

The model utilises custom functions to transition individuals between disease states (compartments) based on calculated probabilities. It follows a stepwise method that mirrors the natural history of TB progression, with transitions repeated iteratively over the entire simulation period (in this case, 10 years). At each time step, transition probabilities are dynamically computed based on the group counts from the previous step, allowing the model to capture changes in the population structure over time.

This implementation predominantly uses base R, featuring original R code developed specifically for this project.

Model Description

The model is implemented in R and structured around seven compartments representing key states in TB infection and care:

S â€“ Susceptible
E â€“ Exposed (Latent infection)
P â€“ Preclinical (non-infectious, early disease)
I â€“ Infectious (active TB)
D â€“ Diagnosed
T â€“ Treated
R â€“ Recovered
Individuals transition between these compartments according to biologically informed probabilities and rates, such as infection probability, progression rates, diagnostic rates, treatment uptake, and recovery. Stochastic transitions are modeled using Bernoulli processes applied at each daily time step.

Transition Flows Include:
Susceptible â†’ Exposed via force of infection
Exposed â†’ Preclinical via reactivation
Preclinical â†’ Infectious via symptom progression
Infectious â†’ Diagnosed via passive detection or diagnostic coverage
Diagnosed â†’ Treated
Treated â†’ Recovered
Recovered â†’ Susceptible via loss of immunity or relapse
Exit/re-entry via mortality and birth modeled as a composite re-entry (recidivism) rate
Parameter Stratification
Recent model developments have incorporated age- and gender-specific progression rates, reflecting evidence that TB exposure and disease progression vary significantly across demographic groups. Additionally, the model now includes differential diagnostic coverage and delay parameters for rural and urban populations, addressing previous limitations of homogeneous diagnostic assumptions. This adjustment is critical given the differing healthcare access and diagnostic reach in these settings, especially considering the tPOC-RDTâ€™s focus on rural implementation.

Use Case

The key model parameters include, but are not limited to:

Parameter	Description
inf.prob	Probability of transmission per contact
act.rate	Number of contacts per person per time step
piu.rateaX	Age-specific progression rates from latent to early infectious (E â†’ P)
delay.rate	Rate of progression from preclinical to clinical TB (P â†’ I)
p_diag_rural_coverage	Proportion of rural preclinical individuals eligible for diagnosis
p_diag_urban_coverage	Proportion of urban preclinical individuals eligible for diagnosis
p_diag_rate	Probability of diagnosis among eligible preclinical individuals (P â†’ D)
i_diag_rural_coverage	Proportion of rural infectious individuals eligible for diagnosis
i_diag_urban_coverage	Proportion of urban infectious individuals eligible for diagnosis
i_diag_rate	Probability of diagnosis among eligible infectious individuals (I â†’ D)
treat.rate	Probability of treatment uptake once diagnosed (D â†’ T)
rec.rate	Rate of recovery following treatment (T â†’ R)
recid.rate	Rate of relapse or TB-related death, balanced by replacement into susceptible pool (R â†’ S)
This model was created to compare baseline conditions to a theoretical implementation of a heat-stable, finger-prick tPOC-RDT with approximately 75â€“80% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Its major benefit is increased diagnostic coverage, particularly in rural populations with limited access to standard TB diagnostics.

Geographic Context

The model parameters and assumptions are loosely based on epidemiological patterns in the Amazonian region of Brazil, with rural/urban disparities explicitly incorporated in diagnostic coverage and delay parameters.

Development Status

ðŸš§ This model is under active development.

Key next steps include:

Validation and tuning of input parameters using empirical epidemiological and field data
Further disaggregation of disease progression and transmission parameters by age, gender, and geographic setting
Separation of composite flows (e.g., disentangling mortality, relapse, and birth from the current recidivism rate)
Extension to include diagnostic delay stratified by setting and population
Incorporation of spatially explicit node-based transmission models using GPS coordinates to capture fine-scale geographic heterogeneity and contact structures
